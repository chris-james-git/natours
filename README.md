# Basic responsive design principles

## Fluid grids and layouts

To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses % rather than px for all layout-related lengths.
Options here: float layouts, flexbox and CSS grid. However, float layouts are most likely to be supported by all browsers, but flexbox and CSS Grid will gain more support in time.

## Flexible / responsive images

Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.

## Media queries

To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create different versions of our website for different widths.
