# NATOURS

This is a coursework project developed in conjunction with the Udemy course "Advanced CSS and Sass" https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/ written by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Full course materials are available here: https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/advanced-css-course

The project uses SASS/CSS and HTML. There is no JavaScript code. The project includes showcases of various modern CSS features such as animations, clip-path, background video, image filtering, form validation, pure CSS popups, advanced media queries and an emphasis on responsive design.

A live deployment of my finished project can be seen here: https://chrisjamesdev.000webhostapp.com/natours/

# Basic responsive design principles

## Fluid grids and layouts

To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses % rather than px for all layout-related lengths.
Options here: float layouts, flexbox and CSS grid. However, float layouts are most likely to be supported by all browsers, but flexbox and CSS Grid will gain more support in time.

## Flexible / responsive images

Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.

## Media queries

To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create different versions of our website for different widths.
